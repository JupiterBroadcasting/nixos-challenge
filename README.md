### [NixOS Challenge](https://linuxunplugged.com/451) Goals:

+ Study the [Nix Expression Language](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/)
+ Setup at least one [Nix/NixOS system](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/)
+ Install htop
+ Join the [Nix Nerds Matrix channel](https://linuxunplugged.com/matrixinfo)
+ Post a screenshot in the Nix Nerds Matrix channel (and/or [here](https://github.com/JupiterBroadcasting/nixos-challenge/discussions/1))!
+ Meaningless Bonus Points<sup>TM</sup> for a full desktop environment
+ Complete all the above before the end of April


At the end of the month, we'll do a review of how it went for folks, moments that stand out, and how Jupiter Broadcasting plans to use Nix going forward based on what we learned.


[Show us all your NixOS screenshots](https://github.com/JupiterBroadcasting/nixos-challenge/discussions/1) and you get.. Meaningless Bonus Points<sup>TM</sup>!
